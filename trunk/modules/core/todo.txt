
- Reading settings: make better output if server fails to start due to errors in xml file

- One to many: design services to be able to deliver from one infolder to many output sources through
splitting of messages

- Move to settings file: hom much statistics should be gatehered, size of queue on service level so that
one service may log 5 minutes back and another could log hours back. Sampling time should also be able to
set in config

- Delete old archives older than x days. Use the archive handler to start this process and look for very old archives.
This way we do not need manual intervention of deleting old archived files. Use same technique to delete old
log files.

- Start and stop of services:   when a service is started it should reread settings from file.
                                can we start up a service which was not in the config file eg after a cloning has been
                                made from a client.

- Refactor and document more

- Implement file to frp handler

- Implement file to web service handler

- Can file to corba handler be more general!?!?

- To be able to view service relations add properties to config settings for service to be able e.g. that
service X -> service Y and service Y -> service Z AND service Q
