/**
 * Example taken from http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/collections/algorithms/index.html
 * 
 * # Fast: It is guaranteed to run in n log(n) time and runs substantially faster 
 * on nearly sorted lists. Empirical tests showed it to be as fast as a highly optimized 
 * quicksort. Quicksort is generally regarded to be faster than merge sort but isn't 
 * stable and doesn't guarantee n log(n) performance.
 * # Stable: It doesn't reorder equal elements. This is important if you sort the same list repeatedly on different attributes. If a user of a mail program sorts the in-box by mailing date and then sorts it by sender, the user naturally expects that the now-contiguous list of messages from a given sender will (still) be sorted by mailing date. This is guaranteed only if the second sort was stable.
